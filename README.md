🌐 GIS: Geographic Information System Web App
Welcome to GIS, a feature-rich web-based Geographic Information System designed for powerful spatial data visualization and analysis.
This repository showcases how to build interactive mapping applications using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks required!

✨ Overview
GIS enables users to visualize, analyze, and interact with geographic data directly in the browser.
Whether you’re mapping locations, exploring spatial patterns, or building custom map layers, this project provides a robust foundation.

🎯 Key Features
Interactive Mapping
Pan, zoom, and explore beautiful maps with smooth interactions.

Layer Management
Add, remove, and toggle different geographic layers (e.g., points, lines, polygons).

Custom Data Upload
Import your own GeoJSON, KML, or CSV files to visualize your data.

Data Filtering
Search and filter data on the map based on attributes or location.

Visual Analytics
Generate heatmaps, cluster points, and display statistics with easy-to-understand visual tools.

Responsive Design
Fully adaptable layouts for desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Theming & Styling
Modern, accessible color schemes and typography for beautiful presentations.
